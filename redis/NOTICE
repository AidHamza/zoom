Packages redis and redis_test were originally created by github user garyburd (Gary).

They come from the redigo repository at https://github.com/garyburd/redigo.
The files are as they were on August 6, 2013, with the exception of
some bug fixes which I may have pulled from the source repository since that date.

Redigo is available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

I have clearly indicated which files I have modified.

Much thanks to Gary for creating this awesome redis driver!
