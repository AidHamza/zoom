Portions of this code are based on the redigo library created by github user garyburd (Gary).

Redigo is available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

The original source files can be found at https://github.com/garyburd/redigo.

The redigo source code was obtained on August 6, 2013 from the github repository and copied
into the redis/ directory. Only one file (scan.go) was modified. The scan.go file includes a
short notice describing exactly what was changed.

Much thanks to Gary for creating this awesome redis driver :)
